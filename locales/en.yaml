I am a computer program that can chat (also known as a 'bot') and I can tell you somehting about you and the messages you send he.\n\nTry it out, just forward me some messages ;)\n\n<b>Note from the developers:</b>\nThis is a very early version of the bot. Therefore a few things (explainatory texts, etc.) are still missing. If you can code, here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/wjclub/telegram-bot-getids\">GitHub repo</a>.

  <b>Account creation date</b>

  <b>How it works</b>
  To quote @Superuser27: Interpolation on known registration dates of certain IDs.
  The bot just has a large list of Account's IDs and their associated (known) creation dates and compares your id against this list.

  <b>My account creation date is wrong</b>
  Sure. That is why there is a "~" in front of it. It is just a guess and very often the IDs given out at a time differ very much from each other, resulting in a sheer data mess. So just consider the date as some sort of art.
